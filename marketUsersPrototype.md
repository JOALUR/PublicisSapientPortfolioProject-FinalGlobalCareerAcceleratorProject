# Market, Users, Prototype

## Understand Your Market

_Provide links to the 3 websites you explored_

https://www.airbnb.com/
https://www.vrbo.com/
https://www.bluepillow.com/

_Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison_

These websites are a relevant comparison due to them also being hospitality websites offering whole-home rentals. I will use them to find features, see how the market is like, what my competitors are doing, and how I can improve my own product.

_List at least 10 product features_

1. A user on Airbnb land on landing page and have the option to search where, see how long, and how many people will be there

2. A user on Airbnb has a variety of filtering options like pricing, amenities, booking options, property type, and so much more

3. A user on Airbnb where" search bar, useful feature and looks nicer than a plain search bar in my opinion

4. A user on Airbnb will see a sliding bar of options you can pick from with options like "mansion", "amazing view", "cabin", and more

5. A user on Vrbo will see options like "popular destinations" and "find spaces that suit your style", great for filtering or even getting ideas for a vacation

6. A user will see if they start scrolling to the bottom a section talking about vacation ideas, users can use this to find ideas or even just dream/plan up a future idea

7. A user on Vrbo lands on the landing page and has the option to search where, dates, and how many travelers

8. A user on BluePillow will also see a section called "Top Destinations" similar to the popular destinations section on Vrbo

9. A user on BluePillow will also find a section for top hotel in most populat destinatons, giving a user many options and places to explore in their desired destination

10. A user on BluePillow will find a section for the top regions users visit

## Understand Your Users

_Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research_

The user research suggests that travelers approach vacation planning with diverse needs, whether it's seeking ideas or narrowing down specific locations. Quantitative data showed that 48.37% users have a type of vacation or area in mind but lack a destination. This shows a need for flexibility and discovery when planning. Qualitative insights highlight frustrations when navigating a website, finding accommodations for large groups or pets, and discovering unique experiences. I believe users want a platform that simplifies decision-making, caters to varied groups, and tailored recommendations for an ideal platform.
